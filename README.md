# Identifier-of-Phenazine-Producing-Bacteria（IPPB）
Analysis scripts for the "Identifier of Phenazine-Producing Bacteria (IPPB)" pipeline.
To assess homology conservation among phz genes, we selected 23 bacterial genomes with documented phz clusters. We computed pairwise similarities between homologous genes within each phz cluster (phzA: 8, phzB: 23, phzC: 21, phzD: 23, phzE: 23, phzF: 23, phzG: 24). Conservatism levels for phzA range from 44.4% to 100%, for phzB from 46.1% to 100%, for phzC from 31.9% to 100%, for phzD from 39.7% to 100%, for phzE from 37.3% to 100%, for phzF from 37.1% to 100%, and for phzG from 30.6% to 100%. Literature indicates PhzC is scarce in phz+ strains but prevalent in non-producers, hence its screening was omitted from our analysis. Additionally, phzA and phzB may coexist or appear singly. Utilizing the conserved gene regions, we conducted an expanded genomic screen following established screening criteria. We systematically screened 1354919 bacterial genomes from the GenBank database, IMG (Integrated Microbial Genomes) database, and NGDC (National Genomics Data Center) database, from which 3349 genomes were identified as containing the phz gene cluster. The genomes were sourced from 191 species across 35 families. We constructed a phylogenetic tree for these families using the 16S sequences of representative species, concurrently mapping the number of species and genomes with the phz gene cluster.
